# Skill: MCP Integration Spec Addendum

## Goal
Add a focused MCP integration section to an existing spec.

## How to use (prompt)

```text
Extend this spec with an “MCP Integration” section.

Include:
- What MCP server/tooling is needed and why
- Inputs/outputs (schemas, fields)
- AuthN/AuthZ and audit requirements
- Error handling and retries
- Rate limits/timeouts
- Observability (logs/metrics)
- Test approach (mocked vs real)

Keep it concise.
```
